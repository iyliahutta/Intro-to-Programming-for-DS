Hello! This repository includes the content, assignment and code files for the Introduction to Programming for Data Science course that I am undertaking for AY22/23 Semester 2 at Singapore Polytechnic. This course is part of the Certificate in Fundamentals of Data Science under the Specialist Diploma in Data Science (Data Analytics).

The course outline can be found [here](https://github.com/iyliahutta/Intro-to-Programming-for-DS/blob/master/AY2110%20s1%20IT8701%20IPDS%20Module%20Overview%20v001.pdf).

The slides for the course content are [here](https://github.com/iyliahutta/Intro-to-Programming-for-DS/tree/master/Slides).

Please feel free to follow me on my journey as I learn Python for Data Science and provide any tips or feedback on any of my code. Thank you!

Continuous Assessment 1 (CA1) on HDB data using basic Python, Numpy and Matplotlib is completed!:
* The Jupyter notebook is [here](https://github.com/iyliahutta/Intro-to-Programming-for-DS/blob/master/CA1/CA1.ipynb)
* The report slides are [here](https://github.com/iyliahutta/Intro-to-Programming-for-DS/blob/master/CA1/CA1%20Slides.pptx)

Continuous Assessment 2 (CA2) is [ongoing](https://github.com/iyliahutta/Intro-to-Programming-for-DS/tree/master/CA2): 
* To use at least three datasets from [data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg)
    * Unrestricted topic with the option to use datasets from anywhere else on the Internet
* To use Pandas for data manipulation
* To use Matplotlib, Seaborn, Bokeh, Pygal etc. for data visualisation
* To store and retrieve data in a relational database such as mySQL or NoSQL database like MongoDB on at least one of the datasets
    * To produce interactive visualisations that allow users to view the data in different ways
