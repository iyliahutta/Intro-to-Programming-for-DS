Hello! This repository includes the content, assignment and code files for the Introduction to Programming for Data Science course that I am undertaking for AY22/23 Semester 2 at Singapore Polytechnic. This course is part of the Certificate in Fundamentals of Data Science under the Specialist Diploma in Data Science (Data Analytics).

The course outline can be found [here](https://github.com/iyliahutta/Intro-to-Programming-for-DS/blob/master/AY2110%20s1%20IT8701%20IPDS%20Module%20Overview%20v001.pdf).

Please feel free to follow me on my journey as I learn Python for Data Science and provide any tips or feedback on any of my code. Thank you!

Lab 1 (Introduction to Python) is [complete](https://github.com/iyliahutta/Intro-to-Programming-for-DS/blob/master/Lab%201/Lab%201.ipynb)!

Lab 2 (Numpy) is [ongoing](https://github.com/iyliahutta/Intro-to-Programming-for-DS/blob/master/Lab%202/).
